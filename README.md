# AMAM - Cordova version
The [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) version of the [Ask me anything meaningful](https://github.com/lsubel/amam) web application. This repository is used to publish the application in the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) repository. You can find the compiled apk [here](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=de.lsubel.amam). Incremental versions of the application are pushed to this repository.

The permissions requested during android installation are the result of the Cordova framework and not used by the application itself.
