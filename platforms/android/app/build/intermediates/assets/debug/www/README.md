# AMAM - Ask me anything meaningful
AMAM is an open source application and written entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

At the end of the 19th century it was a popular game on social events to answer a questionnaire. They should help to learn about the interviewee and their character. The french author Marcel Proust (1871-1922) was one of the most famous people who answered it. This applications allows to get a randomized question from questionnaire, e.g. the Proust questionnaire, so you can discuss it with another person.

Try it on http://lsubel.github.io/amam.

The `master` branch is used for the basic application and is runnable by itself in the browser. The `phonegap` branch contains phonegap specific fields. The `gh-pages` branch is used for the static hosting of the application (link above).

There exist a [repository](https://github.com/lsubel/amam-cordova) with an enhanced version of the application used to build Android apks that can be downloaded via [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).
